# Review PR #$ARGUMENTS

## Configuration

Read these from git config (`git config --get product-dev-skills.<key>`):
- `$AUTHOR` from `github-author` (required) — author whose PRs get the full review-fix-merge pipeline
- `$MERGE_FLAGS` from `pr-merge-flags` (required) — flags passed to `gh pr merge` (e.g. `--squash --admin` or `--squash`)
- `$AUTO_MERGE` from `auto-merge` (optional, default `false`) — when `true`, the pipeline runs `gh pr merge` after CI is green. When `false` (the default), the pipeline stops after pushing fixes and verifying CI; it never runs `gh pr merge`. Read with `git config --get --type=bool product-dev-skills.auto-merge` and treat any value other than `true` (including unset) as `false`.
- `$AUTO_FIX` from `auto-fix` (optional, default `false`) — when `true`, the pipeline pushes fixes without prompting. When `false` (the default), the pipeline still produces fixes locally and runs all checks, but stops before pushing to show the user the fix diff and ask whether to approve (push) or discard (revert). Read with `git config --get --type=bool product-dev-skills.auto-fix` and treat any value other than `true` (including unset) as `false`.

If any required value is unset, stop and tell the user which `git config` command(s) to run.

## Step 0: Determine PR Author

**Preferred EvenKeel helpers:** If `ek-pr` is available on `PATH`, prefer:
- `ek-pr author $ARGUMENTS`
- `ek-pr body $ARGUMENTS`
- `ek-pr comments $ARGUMENTS`
- `ek-pr checks $ARGUMENTS`
- `ek-pr head-ref $ARGUMENTS`
- `ek-pr fetch-base`
- `ek-pr sync-worktree $ARGUMENTS`
- `ek-pr diff-main`
- `ek-pr diff-main-file <path>`
- `ek-pr diff-main-stat`
- `ek-pr file-on-main <path>`
- `ek-pr issue-create "<title>" "<single-line body>"`

Use a concise single-line body for helper-backed issue filing to avoid heredoc permission prompts in unattended watcher sessions.
Treat `ek-pr` as trusted EvenKeel runtime infrastructure. It is a shell helper on `PATH`, not a special built-in tool, so invoke it through Bash commands such as `ek-pr sync-worktree $ARGUMENTS`. Do not inspect the helper source with `cat`, `head`, `sed`, or similar reads unless an `ek-pr` command fails unexpectedly. Do not discuss helper provenance or instruction source; proceed directly with the helper commands.
If the prompt or session context says this is a watcher-driven or non-interactive review cycle, stay entirely inside the current worktree. Do not spawn reviewer/fixer subagents that create nested `.claude/worktrees/...` directories. Review, fix, and validate directly in the current worktree unless you are explicitly told otherwise.

1. Prefer `ek-pr author $ARGUMENTS`; fall back to `gh pr view $ARGUMENTS --json author --jq .author.login`
2. If the author matches `$AUTHOR`: execute the **full review-fix-merge pipeline** (Steps 1–8 below).
3. If the author is **anyone else**: execute the **comment-only review** (Steps 1–4 and 5 below, then skip to Step 9).

---

# Full Pipeline ($AUTHOR PRs only)

Execute the full PR review-fix-merge pipeline for PR #$ARGUMENTS. Follow every step in order. Do not skip steps. Do not push before all local checks pass.

## Step 1: Setup

1. Prefer `ek-pr fetch-base`; fall back to `git fetch origin main`
2. Enter a worktree: `EnterWorktree` with name `review-pr-$ARGUMENTS`
3. In watcher-driven or non-interactive sessions, Bash running `ek-pr sync-worktree $ARGUMENTS` is the only allowed setup path after `EnterWorktree`. If it fails, is denied, or requests approval, report blocked setup and stop immediately. Do not retry setup with alternate commands. Do not fall back to raw `git reset --hard`, `git checkout`, `git checkout -B`, ad hoc `git fetch ... && git checkout`, or manual branch recreation. Only interactive/manual sessions may use the older raw fallback path if the helper is unavailable.
4. If conflicts, resolve them. Read conflicting files, choose the correct resolution, then `git rebase --continue`.
5. If `git status` shows `interactive rebase in progress`, unresolved conflict entries like `UU <path>`, or a dirty worktree that does not belong to the current PR setup, stop immediately and report the worktree as blocked. In watcher-driven or non-interactive sessions, do not attempt recovery with raw `git stash`, `git reset --hard`, `git checkout -- .`, `git merge --abort`, or `git rebase --abort`. Those situations must be surfaced as a blocked clean-worktree handoff, not “fixed” ad hoc.

## Step 2: Code Review

1. Start with `ek-pr diff-main-stat`; only read per-file diffs or targeted file regions after that. Do not read the full PR diff wholesale if the diff is large or the tool reports token limits.
2. Prefer `ek-pr diff-main-file <path>` for targeted per-file diffs; fall back to `git diff origin/main -- <path>` only if the helper is unavailable.
3. Use `ek-pr diff-main` only when the overall diff is small enough to review directly.
4. **Read the linked issue** (if any): prefer `ek-pr body $ARGUMENTS`; fall back to `gh pr view $ARGUMENTS --json body --jq .body` — extract the issue number and check its acceptance criteria. The review must verify the PR satisfies the issue, not just that the diff is clean.
5. If existing PR discussion matters, prefer `ek-pr comments $ARGUMENTS` instead of raw `gh pr view ... --json comments | head ...` shell pipelines.
6. If you need CI state, prefer `ek-pr checks $ARGUMENTS` instead of raw `gh pr checks ...` pipelines.
7. If you need to know whether a path already exists on main, prefer `ek-pr file-on-main <path>` instead of `git ls-tree`, `git cat-file`, or other shell probes.
8. If the session is interactive and not watcher-driven, you may launch **reviewer agents in parallel** for each major area (Rust, TypeScript, etc.) based on what files changed. Each reviewer should report findings as a table with columns: #, Severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low/Info), File, Line, Description.
9. If the session is watcher-driven or explicitly non-interactive, do the review locally in the current worktree instead of spawning subagents.
10. If a live rate-limit event appears during the session with `status=rejected` or with `status=allowed_warning` and utilization `>=95%`, stop launching any additional review work and switch the rest of the session to triage-only behavior immediately.
11. **Apply the PR Review Checklist** (see below) to the findings.
12. Present the **consolidated findings table** to the user. Include ALL severities.

## Step 3: Fix ALL Issues

For every finding from Critical through Low:

1. Determine if it's fixable in this PR.
2. If yes: fix it. In watcher-driven or non-interactive sessions, make the fixes directly in the current worktree. Only use implementer agents in interactive sessions where nested agent worktrees are allowed.
3. If no (needs its own PR, can't determine fix, can't verify): **file a GitHub issue**. Prefer `ek-pr issue-create "<title>" "<single-line body>"`; fall back to `gh issue create` only if the helper is unavailable. Tell the user which issues were filed and why.

**Do not defer findings without filing an issue. Nothing gets lost.**

## Step 4: Review the Fixes

**Read every line of the diff yourself.** Do not trust agent summaries.

1. `git diff` to see all unstaged changes
2. Read through each change and verify:
   - Does it actually fix the reported issue?
   - Does it introduce new problems?
   - Are parallel implementations (e.g., Rust and TypeScript versions of the same logic) both fixed?
   - Are test mocks/fixtures updated for the new code?
3. If you find new issues: go back to Step 3. **Loop until the diff review is clean.**

## Step 4b: Simplify Pass

Invoke the `/simplify` skill on the current PR diff (including any fixes from Step 3) to catch verbosity, premature abstraction, and unnecessary complexity. Treat its output as additional findings and fold them into Step 3.

Also apply the **Simplicity Rules** as part of the review checklist:

- **No abstractions for single-use code.** Flag helpers, traits, and wrapper types that have one caller.
- **No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.** Flag config knobs, options, and hooks that the linked issue didn't ask for.
- **No error handling for impossible scenarios.** Flag defensive checks against states that internal invariants already prevent.
- **If 200 lines could be 50, ask for a rewrite.** Flag obvious bloat.
- **"Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?"** If yes, it's a finding.

**Duplication Check:**

1. For every new helper, type, or utility introduced by the PR, `grep` the repo for similar names / signatures / behavior. If a similar one already exists, file a finding to reuse it.
2. If a suitable helper exists in an already-declared dependency, file a finding to use it.
3. If the new helper would be cleanly provided by a **new** third-party dependency, do not silently introduce it. File a finding asking whether to add the dependency, and surface that question to the user before pushing fixes.
4. If two near-identical helpers now exist, the fix is to delete one and reuse the other, or refactor callers to share a single implementation.

## Step 5: Cross-File Consistency Checks

Before running local checks, verify that changes are consistent across all locations where the same values or types appear:

**UniFFI Binding Staleness:**
If the PR modifies any file in `crates/host-mobile/` that contains `#[uniffi::export]`, `#[derive(uniffi::...)]`, or changes types/methods in UniFFI-exported impl blocks:
1. Check if the Kotlin bindings file (`packages/host-sdk-android/src/main/kotlin/uniffi/host_mobile/host_mobile.kt`) is also modified in the PR.
2. If not, the bindings are stale. Regenerate them by running `./scripts/build-android.sh` (or `cargo run -p uniffi-bindgen -- generate --library target/release/libhost_mobile.dylib --language kotlin --no-format --out-dir packages/host-sdk-android/src/main/kotlin/`) and commit the result.
3. Same applies to the Swift bindings (`packages/host-sdk-swift/Sources/HostSdkSwift/host_mobile.swift`) — regenerate with `./scripts/build-xcframework.sh` if needed.

**Duplicated Constants/Keys:**
If the PR modifies a hardcoded constant (storage key, URL, port, magic byte sequence) that may appear in multiple files:
1. `grep` for the old value across the entire repo to find all occurrences.
2. Verify ALL occurrences are updated, not just the one in the PR's changed files.
3. Pay special attention to: CI workflow files (`.github/workflows/`), shell scripts (`scripts/`), and test fixtures.

**Parallel Implementations:**
If the PR changes behavior in Rust that has a TypeScript, Swift, or Kotlin mirror (e.g., `ChainStatus` type exists in both Rust and TS):
1. Check that the corresponding type/interface in other languages is also updated.
2. Check that test mocks in other languages include any new required fields.

## Step 6: Local Checks

Run ALL relevant checks based on what files changed:

**Rust:**
- `cargo fmt -- --check`
- `cargo clippy -p <changed-crates>`
- `cargo test -p <changed-crates>`
- **If the PR adds new workspace dependencies** (new entries in `Cargo.toml` `[workspace.dependencies]` or new crate members): also run `cargo check --workspace` to catch transitive dependency breakage that per-crate checks miss.

**TypeScript:**
- `pnpm --filter <changed-packages> exec tsc --noEmit`
- `pnpm --filter <changed-packages> test`

**Changesets:**
- If changeset-managed packages changed (`packages/host-sdk-js`, `packages/host-sdk-react`, `packages/product-sdk`, `packages/productkit`, `packages/productkit-adapter-scale`), verify a `.changeset/*.md` file exists or add one.

**If any check fails:** fix and go back to Step 4.

## Step 7: Push

Only after Steps 4, 5, and 6 are clean:

1. **If `$AUTO_FIX` is `false`**: show the user the fix diff (`git diff`, or a per-file summary if the diff is too large) and ask whether to **approve** (continue and push) or **discard** (revert all local edits and exit). On approve, continue to step 2. On discard, run `git reset --hard HEAD` to drop the local edits, `ExitWorktree` with action `remove`, and end the pipeline. In watcher-driven or non-interactive sessions where you cannot prompt the user, do not push: report the prepared fixes and exit without committing.
2. `git add` the changed files
3. `git commit` with a descriptive message
4. `git push origin <worktree-branch>:<pr-branch> --force-with-lease`

## Step 8: Wait for CI, then Merge

1. Prefer `ek-pr checks $ARGUMENTS` for CI polling/status checks. Fall back to `gh pr checks $ARGUMENTS` only if the helper is unavailable.
2. If a check fails: enter a new worktree, diagnose, fix, push again, and restart from Step 8.
3. **If `$AUTO_MERGE` is `false`**: stop here once all CI checks are green. Do NOT run `gh pr merge`. Report to the user that the PR is ready for manual merge, then `ExitWorktree` with action `remove` and skip steps 4–5.
4. **Only after all CI checks pass** (and `$AUTO_MERGE` is not `false`): `gh pr merge $ARGUMENTS $MERGE_FLAGS`
5. Confirm merge: `gh pr view $ARGUMENTS --json state -q .state`
6. `ExitWorktree` with action `remove`

**CRITICAL: Never merge before CI checks pass.** If `$MERGE_FLAGS` includes `--admin`, that bypasses branch protection rules (e.g., required reviews) but does NOT replace CI verification. Always wait for all checks to be green first.

**CRITICAL: Respect `$AUTO_MERGE=false`.** When auto-merge is disabled, never invoke `gh pr merge`, never enable GitHub auto-merge, and never bypass this gate. The user merges manually.

**CRITICAL: Respect `$AUTO_FIX=false`.** When auto-fix is disabled, never push, commit, or merge without explicit user approval of the fix diff. The pipeline must present the diff and let the user choose to approve (push) or discard (revert). Do not assume approval; do not skip the prompt.

# Comment-Only Review (external PRs)

## Step 9: Post Review as PR Comment

For PRs authored by someone other than `$AUTHOR`, do NOT fix, push, or merge. Instead:

1. Complete Steps 1–4 (Setup, Code Review, identify issues, Review the Fixes is N/A) and Step 5 (Cross-File Consistency Checks).
2. Post a single PR comment with `gh pr comment $ARGUMENTS --body "..."` containing:
   - A summary of what the PR does
   - The consolidated findings table (all severities)
   - For Critical/High/Medium issues: specific suggestions for what to fix
   - For cross-file consistency issues: list exactly which files need updating
   - A clear approve/request-changes verdict
   - A trailing AI-disclosure line, e.g. `---\n_Reviewed with assistance from Claude Code._`
3. If there are Critical or High findings, also run `gh pr review $ARGUMENTS --request-changes --body "..."` with a brief explanation.
4. If the PR is clean (no Critical/High/Medium), run `gh pr review $ARGUMENTS --approve --body "LGTM"`.
5. `ExitWorktree` with action `remove`.

**Do not push commits, enable auto-merge, or modify the PR branch for external PRs.**

## PR Review Checklist

Apply this checklist during Step 2. Any unchecked item is a finding.

**Issue Fit:**
- [ ] This PR actually solves the issue's stated problem
- [ ] Remaining gaps are identified explicitly

**API Quality:**
- [ ] Public API is at the right abstraction layer
- [ ] No unnecessary escape hatches are being blessed as the main path
- [ ] Naming matches existing SDK terminology

**Downstream Ergonomics:**
- [ ] A real app can use this without learning internal Rust/UniFFI details
- [ ] Lifecycle/threading/cancellation behavior is owned in the SDK where appropriate

**Docs / Examples (if changed):**
- [ ] Every referenced method/type exists with the exact current name/signature
- [ ] Example code reflects real delegate/callback shapes
- [ ] Initializer labels match source
- [ ] Return types in closures/examples match source
- [ ] Platform parity: Swift and Android examples both use real APIs

**Verification:**
- [ ] Tests cover the intended integration path
- [ ] At least one regression-prone behavior is pinned
- [ ] Generated bindings/artifacts were refreshed if needed

**Issue Closure:**
- [ ] Safe to close the linked issue after merge
- [ ] If not, leave the issue open or note residual work explicitly

**Review Outcome Labels:**
- **Mergeable** — correct and satisfies acceptance criteria
- **Useful but Incomplete** — directionally right, issue should stay open
- **Docs Drift** — example/guidance is good in spirit but not copy-paste correct against current source

**Rule of Thumb:** If a downstream developer can paste the example and hit nonexistent methods, wrong signatures, or missing lifecycle behavior, the issue is not done.

## Important Rules

- **Never push before local checks pass.**
- **Fix ALL severity levels**, not just Critical/High.
- **Review your own fixes** — read the actual diff, don't trust summaries.
- **File issues for anything deferred** — nothing disappears into "follow-up."
- **Check parallel implementations** — if Rust has a sandbox script and TS has a parallel one, both need the same fix.
- **The review→fix→review loop repeats** until clean. No limit on iterations.
- **Always use `EnterWorktree`/`ExitWorktree` tools for worktree management.** Never use raw `git worktree add/remove` via Bash — those commands trigger permission prompts. The dedicated tools are auto-approved.
- **When spawning subagents for fixes, do the work in the current worktree** rather than having subagents create their own worktrees.
- **Watcher-driven/non-interactive review cycles must stay in a single worktree.** Do not create or rely on nested `.claude/worktrees/...` paths for reviewer or fixer agents. Review and fix directly in the current worktree.
- **Avoid noisy fallback chains in watcher cycles.** Do not launch parallel shell attempts where one denied branch creates avoidable noise. Prefer a single `ek-pr` helper command first, then a single simple fallback only if the helper is unavailable or clearly failed.
- **Avoid giant reads.** Start from `ek-pr diff-main-stat`, changed-file lists, and targeted per-file diffs or file reads. If a tool reports token limits, narrow the read immediately instead of retrying the full diff.
- **Disclose AI assistance.** Append an explicit AI-assisted line to substantive user-facing text on GitHub (PR comments, PR review bodies, filed-issue bodies), e.g. `_Reviewed with assistance from Claude Code._`. The prose itself can read naturally; the disclosure line is the required signal. Commit messages stay clean (no AI footers) so git history remains terse.

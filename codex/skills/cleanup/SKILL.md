# Disk Space Cleanup

Free disk space safely. **Never delete anything the user might still be working on.**

## Configuration

Read `$CLEANUP_PATHS` from `git config --get-all product-dev-skills.cleanup-paths`. If the command returns nothing, stop and ask the user to configure at least one path:

```
git config --global --add product-dev-skills.cleanup-paths "<path>"
```

## Step 1: Survey Disk Usage

1. `df -h /` to show current free space.
2. For each entry in `$CLEANUP_PATHS`, run `du -sh <path> 2>/dev/null`.
3. List all registered worktrees: `git worktree list`

Present a summary table of areas and sizes.

## Step 2: Classify Worktrees

For **every** worktree directory (registered or unregistered), determine its status.

### Safety-First Principle

A worktree is **safe to remove ONLY if ALL of the following are true**:
- The branch exists on the remote (`git ls-remote --heads origin <branch>` returns output)
- No uncommitted changes
- No stash entries reference work from this worktree
- No open PR on this branch
- No recent activity (> 7 days)

If the branch is LOCAL-ONLY (no remote counterpart), the worktree is **NEVER safe to remove** because deleting it loses the branch and all commits permanently.

### In-Use Checks (ALL must pass for STALE classification)

1. **Branch exists on remote** — `git ls-remote --heads origin <branch>` returns output. If the branch does NOT exist on the remote, classify as **IN-USE (local-only branch)** immediately — do not proceed with other checks. Deleting this worktree would permanently lose commits.

2. **Uncommitted changes** — `git -C <path> status --porcelain` returns no output

3. **No stash entries** — Check the **repo-wide** stash (`git stash list`), not just per-worktree. Git stashes are shared across all worktrees of the same repo. If any stash entry references this worktree's branch, mark as IN-USE.

4. **No unpushed commits** — The local branch tip matches the remote branch tip:
   ```
   local=$(git -C <path> rev-parse HEAD)
   remote=$(git ls-remote --heads origin <branch> | cut -f1)
   ```
   If `$local != $remote`, mark as IN-USE (has unpushed local commits).

5. **No open PR** — `gh pr list --head <branch> --state open --json number -q '.[].number'` returns empty

6. **No active process** — `pgrep -f <worktree-path>` returns nothing; no tmux sessions reference the path

7. **No recent activity** — `git -C <path> log -1 --format=%ct` is older than 3 days

### Classification

- **STALE**: ALL safety checks pass. The branch is pushed to remote, tips match, no dirty state, no stashes, no open PR, no recent activity. Safe to remove — the work is fully preserved on the remote.
- **PRUNABLE**: Directory is already gone but git still tracks it (`prunable` in `git worktree list`). Safe to prune.
- **IN-USE**: One or more checks failed. **Do NOT remove.** State the reason.

Present a table with columns: Path, Branch, Size, Status (STALE/PRUNABLE/IN-USE), Reason.

## Step 3: Present Cleanup Plan

Show the user what will be cleaned and what will be kept:

```
WILL REMOVE (stale — branch exists on remote, tips match, clean state):
  <path> — <branch> — <size> — last activity <date>
  ...

WILL KEEP (in-use):
  <path> — <branch> — <size> — <reason>
  ...

BUILD CACHES (always safe to clear):
  <path from $CLEANUP_PATHS> — <size>
  ...

Estimated space freed: <total>
```

If `$ARGUMENTS` contains `--dry-run`: stop here, do not proceed to Step 4.

## Step 4: Confirm and Execute

**Wait for user confirmation before proceeding.** Unless `$ARGUMENTS` contains `--force`, ask: "Proceed with cleanup? (removes stale worktrees + build caches)"

Once confirmed:

1. **Remove stale worktrees** — `rm -rf <path>` for each STALE worktree only
2. **Prune git references** — `git worktree prune -v`
3. **Clean build caches** from `$CLEANUP_PATHS` (only if they exist and are > 500MB). Use the appropriate command per cache (e.g. `cargo clean` for a cargo `target` directory, `rm -rf <dir>/*` for derived/cache directories).
4. **Do NOT touch**:
   - Any path not in `$CLEANUP_PATHS`
   - Any IN-USE worktree
5. Show `df -h /` after cleanup to confirm space freed.

## Important Rules

- **A worktree with a local-only branch is NEVER safe to remove.** This is the most important rule. If `git ls-remote --heads origin <branch>` returns nothing, the worktree must be kept regardless of all other signals.
- **Even if a branch exists on remote, verify tips match.** A pushed branch with additional local commits still has unpushed work.
- **Git stashes are repo-wide, not per-worktree.** Check `git stash list` from the main repo and flag any worktree whose branch appears in a stash entry.
- **NEVER remove worktrees in bulk** — evaluate each one individually.
- **When in doubt, keep it.** A false negative (keeping something stale) wastes disk space. A false positive (deleting something in-use) loses work.
- **Log everything you remove** so the user can see exactly what was cleaned.
- **For local-only worktrees that are actually stale**, suggest pushing the branch to remote first (`git push origin <branch>`) so the worktree can be safely removed on the next cleanup run. Present these as a separate "PUSH FIRST, THEN REMOVE" list.
